Implementation and testing of [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3736252.3742581).

Action plans
- [x] MEV optimization algorithm implementation.
- [x] Sanity check over example scenario.
- [x] Collect data from mempool.
    - [x] Dump tx data.
    - [x] filter to `to` that matches known DEX.
    - [x] Decode data using ABI.
    - [x] Parse & Analyze.
    - [x] Test the algorithm.
- [ ] Explain the project and document findings.


## The problem: MEV

## Assumptions

## Data collection (target DEX)

## Outcomes

## MEV vs Gas fee trade-off
